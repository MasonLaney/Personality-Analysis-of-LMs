# Personality-Analysis-of-LMs

Repository associated with my Senior Honors Thesis, [The Effects of Fine-Tuning on the Personality Traits of Large Language Models](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/honors_theses/ws859r61t). 

This repo contains a lot of messy and duplicate code, but I wanted to go ahead and make it public so that people could see it. I will work on cleaning it up over the next couple of months.
